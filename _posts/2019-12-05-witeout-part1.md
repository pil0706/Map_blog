title: Apple Maps Mistakes Part 01 | 애플 지도 실수 파트 01
---


For some reasons,<br>
I keep posting Apple Maps mistakes.<br>
<br>
One, I like their services and products.<br>
Two, I use their services and products almost everyday.<br>
Three, there seem to be a lot more things to do <br>
(in other words, I see what they need to do more to improve their maps) and therefore,<br>
I also learned from their maps.
<br>
<br>
The beginning of November was the day I noticed Apple Maps' error.<br>
If I am not wrong, it was November 3rd. Because I showed it to just visited Apple Siri developers at NAVER on 5th of November.

Anyway, what I want to point out is the Korean Channel along with the disputing area Dokdo <br>
(or Takeshima according to the Japanese government's opinion).<br>
They are wite-out.


From this, I assumed Apple Maps do care about disputing areas.<br>
Not only the holes, but the multi-language setting confirmed how Apple Maps treats disputing areas.


Here, I set the language setting in English.

But what about the island?<br>
The island is very tiny and the label doesn't need to show up in small scale (lower zoom level).

But, once I zoom-in the label is different.

As an English-Korean bilingual cartographer, I barely noticed the mistakes, for I read the two languages.

I posted on Twitter and asked a friend of mine at Apple. But nothing has changed.<br>
But the holes are still not filled up yet. It was bizarre.


The last week of November, I visited Japan again.


The map I saw in Japan and Korea is totally different.

Yes, they are showing different maps according to where you are accessed from.<br>
Plus, it reminded me that Apple Korea does not have a map service team.




- Notice <br>
'The Korean channel and water polygon missing' articles will be uploaded soon.
