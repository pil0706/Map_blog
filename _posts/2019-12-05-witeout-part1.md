title: Apple Maps Mistakes Part 1
---


For some reasons,
I keep posting Apple Maps mistakes.

One, I like their services and products.
Two, I use their services and products almost everyday.
Three, there seem to be a lot more things to do (in other words, I see what they need to do more to improve their maps) and therefore, I also learned from their maps.


The beginning of November was the day I noticed Apple Maps' error.
If I am not wrong, it was November 3rd. Because I showed it to just visited Apple Siri developers at NAVER on 5th of November.

Anyway, what I want to point out is the Korean Channel along with the disputing area Dokdo (or Takeshima according to the Japanese government's opinion). They are wite-out.


From this, I assumed Apple Maps do care about disputing areas.
Not only the holes, but the multi-language setting confirmed how Apple Maps treats disputing areas.


Here, I set the language setting in English.

So, all labels are printed in English.


But what about the island?
The island is very tiny and the label doesn't need to show up in small scale (lower zoom level).

But, once I zoom-in the label is different.

As an English-Korean bilingual cartographer, I barely noticed the mistakes, for I read the two languages.

I posted on Twitter and asked a friend of mine at Apple. But nothing has changed.
But the holes are still not filled up yet. It was bizarre.


The last week of November, I visited Japan again.



The map I saw in Japan and Korea is totally different.

Ah! Apple Korea does not have a map service team!
