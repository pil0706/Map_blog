title: Label Placement / 레이블 위치 정하기
---

As I am a cartographer (at least, that how I call my self), POI and its label (fonts) are more important than basemap.

Let's say the basemap looks legit. Yet, the label and poi markers(icons) are bad, then the MAP does not look alright. No matter how much time you spent to make the basemap, the awful label (fonts) will contaminate the overall map design.
(I used the word 'contaminate', because it really does)

These days, I am really thinking about typography (or font in my term) and chromatics (or coloring in my term) in order to make better maps, which has better readability.

By the way, I am also interested in 'Asian' way of geography (풍수지리), also known as Feng Shui (in chinese) and I do not know in English. The chinese words came from Papago Translate (Google Translate like in Korea).
Therefore, I always thought about how to implement Asian way of thoughts in making maps. Because cartography itself is originated from the Western side of the world.

When cartographers make maps, understanding the taget country's culture and custom is the key to drag to succeful map service.

One of my favorite countries, Japan, still a lot of people are reading books in vertically right to left and that is still in common.
I thought about how I am implement that way of label placement for Japanese and for those who admire Japanese culture.

In the past, Asian maps had very BAD readability (and they did not have the concept of projections)
I have to say I am not condescending asian cartographers, for in the past western maps also did not have any concepts of those. But, this is the fact that Mercator did make really awesome map (but I am not saying mercator proejction is perfact) and in the end europeans conquered the world until the world war II.

Again, as I am a 'Asian' cartographer, who were educated in the US, better readability and more information comes first.

But how I am going to mingle with Asian culture with westernized cartography method, along with GIS knoweldege.

Well, Mapbox did that for me.
Today, Mapbox did the exprement with vertical label placement in Tokyo, Japan.

When this API comes for public, I will monkey around and post it.
