In the previous article, <br>
I wrote about Labels. [Hopping Labels](https://pil0706.github.io/Position-of-POIs)
<br>
<br>
Recently, I am very into readability of maps. <br>
<br>
What I think about a good map is <br>
geometric and text information are well mingled without any eyesoar.
- Eyesore <- this is very vague and controversial, <br>
   for some people might not think what I think is not an eyesore.
<br>
Anyway, the best way of minimizing the side-effect of mingling the two information is, I keep saying,<br>
"the balance".
<br>
<br>
Despite of balancing the information, "important features" should outstand. <br>
<br>

The list of important features can be
- Highway Exits (in the U.S.)
- Subway/Rail Stations and Exits (in big cities)
- Landmark Buildings
- Spacious Parks
- and so forth...
<br>

Because I found out noticeable changes in Google Maps, <br>
I chose to introduce Subway/Rail Station Exits.

<br>
<br>
In big and complicating cities like Tokyo, Seoul, Chicago and New York City,<br>
the rail/subway exits one of the keys to find routes.
<br>
<br>
Let's say you are explaining a location using this map below. <br>
There are so many roads and buildings. <br>
<br>

<br>
You can't label them all in this small space. <br>
What can be landmarks in this region then? <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, <br>
you can simply tell position of something using exits.


<br>
<br>
However, Google Maps did not exaggerate the exit symbol a few weeks ago.

<br>
<br>


Luckily, <br>
I was able to find an old styled google maps. <br>

One is Google Maps in 2017 and the other one is in 2019 <br>
You can easily notice the exit number.

<br>
<br>


Numazu, where my good friend lives, all exits are changed to new symbol style

<br>

But not all Japanese rail/subway exits are changed.

Yes, there still are a lot more things to do in making maps.
