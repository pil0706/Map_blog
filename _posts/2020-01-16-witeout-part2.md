title: Apple Maps Mistakes Part 2
---


It is always good to understand the historical and political background <br>
of a country when you make maps.


Fortunately, I am learning South Korea after I moved back from the States <br>
and also learning Japan simultaneously.


I think I am understanding both nations' backgrounds more than average. <br>
Not perfect though, the knowledge of the two countries might be enough to start to make maps.

<br>
<br>
<br>
I wrote too much introduction.<br>
<br>
<br>

Okay.. so in the last article, <br>
I showed holes/wite-out parts between the two countries.<br>

<br>
<br>

And I promised to write about waterbody missing between the countries.

<br>
<br>
<br>
So, here it is.
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a Channel between Tsushima (Japan) and Busan (Korea), the Korean Channel.

<br>
<br>
<br>

I had an experience of making world waterbodies with OpenStreetMap (1:2,000,000),<br>
Korea (1:5000) and Japan (1:2500)

<br>
<br>


Although a free-hand drawing cut is convenient and fast, <br>
I tried to make convexhull or create as clean-cut as possible like a checkerboard.<br>
<br>
At least, I wanted to use referenced rules, <br>
such as borrowing the International Maritime Organization's border.

<br>
<br>

Let's see how the wite-out part looks like in Apple Maps. <br>
The Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo or Takeshima) is clearly wite-out with making a perfect circle.

<br>
but the wite-out part on the Korean Channel is somewhat awkward. <br>
I do not see any kind of perfectness there.
<br>
<br>
The awkwardness is exaggerated when it is on a larger scale.

Well.. Apple Maps seemed to use a free-hand method to merge waterbodies.

But, my map's waterbodies/coastline did not use a free-hand drawing cut-out. <br>
I just did not want to work that way.



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


This is a screenshot of the waterbodies of Japan and Korea I used to work with.<br>
The blue line is on the Korean Channel, where 'water boundaries between the two countries'.

I thought about using EEZ to cut-out each country's waterbodies.<br>
HERE, I downloaded EEZ data from natural earth

And this was the result of merging waterbody layers.

Hmm.. a free-hand drawing cut-out seems a lot more convenient.
