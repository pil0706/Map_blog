title: Apple Maps Mistakes Part 1
---


It is always good to understand the historical and political background of a country when you make maps.


Fortunately, I am learning South Korea after I moved back from the States and also learning Japan simultaneously.

I think I am understanding both nations' backgrounds more than average. Not perfect though, the knowledge of the two countries might be enough to start to make maps.




I wrote too much introduction.
Okay.. so in the last article, I showed holes/wite-out parts between the two countries.


And I promised to write about waterbody missing between the countries.




So, here it is.



There is a Channel between Tsushima (Japan) and Busan (Korea), the Korean Channel.

I had an experience of making world waterbodies with OpenStreetMap (1:2,000,000), Korea (1:5000) and Japan (1:2500) 


Although a free-hand drawing cut is convenient and fast, I tried to make convexhull or create as clean-cut as possible like a checkerboard.


Let's see how the wite-out part looks like in Apple Maps.
The Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo or Takeshima) is clearly wite-out with making a perfect circle.

but the wite-out part on the Korean Channel is somewhat awkward. I do not see any kind of perfectness there.

The awkwardness is exaggerated when it is on a larger scale.

Well, Apple Maps seemed to use a free-hand method to merge waterbodies.

But, my map's waterbodies/coastline did not use a free-hand drawing cut-out. I just did not want to work that way.





Here, I attached how I did to merge Korea and Japan waterbodies together a long long time ago.


This is a screenshot of the waterbodies of Japan and Korea. The blue line is on the Korean Channel, where 'water boundaries between the two countries'.

I thought about using EEZ to cut-out each country's waterbodies.
HERE, I downloaded EEZ data from natural earth

And this was the result of merging waterbody layers.

Hmm.. a free-hand drawing cut-out seems a lot more convenient.
