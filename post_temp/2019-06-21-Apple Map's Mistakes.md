title: Learn from others mistakes - Apple Maps (2/2) / 다른사람의 실수로부터 배우기 - Apple Maps (2/2)
---

From the previous story, </br>
I am going to continue to write errors which I have found from other map service providers. </br>
Most likely Apple and Google.

Before I start to write article, I have to make it clear that I am not attacking Apple Maps or employees there though you are going to see quite lots of their mistakes.



Long story short, Apple is struggling to make maps.</br>
That is the conclusion of this article. From Apple's mistakes I am trying not to make same mistakes they made. </br>
So, for certain areas, my map is better than theirs. </br>

Again, don't get me wrong. I love Apple products and devices (Watch, AirPod, iPhone, iMac, Macbook <- yes, these are what I use everyday) </br>

All these is based on my instinct/feeling/thoughts of their maps after analyzing their maps for 2 years.




Apple Maps Mistakes (POI/ICON/Buildings on Water/음차/)


- Let's start with pedestrian overpass.
One day, I took a bus from Narita Airport to Downtown Tokyo. </br>
I turned on maps and started to compare services. It's my habit. I do everyday.

Data modellign wise, Apple is correct (or iPC) but because they did not choose to use real-width road shape, weird disconnection of the pedestrian overpass is eyesoar
Google seemed to okay but it should go below the express highway
Both are wrong, or maybe both are right according to their own mapping policy or philsophy.

So, this is my conclusion that Apple is combining all the data from here and there and 
(But, maybe I am wrong)


Tokyo, as one of the most complex cities in the world, is very hard to spatialize the city. Countless overpass, pedestrian deck, bridges, tunnel but highway ramp but also highway exit are something you will never find in other countries.
Meguro Sky Garden is one of my landmark when I map Tokyo.

Google has changed their data provider from Zenrin (Zenrin Web) to their own. And Google Maps (Japan) is improving day by day.

It improved much and it does not look like a tunnel still I do not see the building

Because Meguro Sky Garden is one big giant building on street level (and most of Tokyoite are waking or biking)
From the aerial view, futsal field and skygarden are the two most outstanding features there.

(By the way, the cafe on the leftside is one of my favorite dessert/cafe in Nakameguro)
So, I have to raise a hand for Zenrin


But, Google announced Spatial Data Independence of Japan. I have to say they are darn badass.










Same Bug Vs. Not Good Endcap?

Trivial errors, it was meaningless to post them here. But these phenomena were very dramatic and I decided to post and share my thoughts on this.
