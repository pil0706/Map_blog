Because of limited space,
it is always hard to show all the labels on a map.


Let's say you are in a situation of labeling names of countries, especially in a lower zoom level.


Each one of labels are very important.
If a country's label is hided or overlapped by another country's, someone might be upset.


Therefore, cartographers must choose what to show or where to locate labels under a clear policy.


One day,
One of my colleagues asked me, can a label of Portugal be shown in low zoom level.


For instance, adjacent countries, Spain and Portugal,
Portugal might not show up, for Spain takes space.
In other words, there is no enough space to pose the label of Portugal.

If I were a Portuguese, I might be upset.

However, if the cartographer is Spanish?
Spain comes first than Portugal, for his sake.


To not to get egged, I see that Google Maps adjusts the labels in each zoom level.

From Zoom Lv5, it seems like the label keeps its position till it gets dissapeared.

On the other hand, Apple Maps does seem to change labels location.

Apple Maps keeps their lable position consistently; on the other hand, Google Maps is more flexible in their label position.


Based on my almost 9 years of map making experiences, it's very obvious that Apple and Google adjust unmovable labels manually.
> I just coined out the term 'unmovalbe labels'. Unmovable Lables can be defined as labels of countries, cities, airport, etc.

I can tell they are not using centroid of each countries.

I used 'Centroid on Surface' to have center points of each countries.
Here, I drew arrows between countries' centroid and Google's label.

The reason why I am showing this is that I want to emphasize Google and Apple did not just use simple centroid for labeling but **someone** (and I strongly believe that he or she is a very well cartographer who carries Google and Apple's internal policies or philosophies) manually replotted them.

Google changes their location level by level, on the other hand
Apple sets its initial location and uses all zoom levels

Here, it took me forever to capture Apple Maps level by level

Seems like Google also considered capital cities for the country label positions.
For instance, Poland label slightly went down because the Warsaw label can be overlapped with Poland label.

Same issue comes almost in everywhere in Europe.
Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Spain, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Hungary, Czech, Italy, etc.

If there are no more space to move the labels (like Belgium & the Nerherlands), Google decided to reduce the font size based on its area.

One funny thing is Belarus is very Big country though the label is smaller than its neighbors












I draw squares where country label is supposed to be (without manual adjustment / with using centroid of country) and its capital label.

Countries like Japan, Indoneia, China, Russia, and the Philippines show dramatic













Google's method is easier? or Apple? 
I personally think Apple took harder way to go.
Because in lower zoom level, it is hard to consider all the important cities. Google, for me it's more rational, to change the country label's location and changes it in each level.




Something came up to my mind that Apple might have a tool to support a tool like Google has.
If you are working for a cartographer, you would know what I meant.
For those who are not familiar, let me explain.

Usually, a point stays one position and it becomes a label on a map.
When lable has to pop like Google, a point should have multiple positions.
What I can assume is Google has multiple tables of coutry labels for each level or they have a VERY NICE tool to control all that.

On the other hand, Apple might not. In this case, they should keep only one table and make very precise initial position.


I would make multiple tables and pop the label position like Google (still doesn't know Google uses multiple tables though)










도시와 나라 오버랩





City




In some cases, a city name can be more important than other countries' name.
or a country's capital can be hided by its country's name.

For instance, Vatican is a country but Rome is a capital. Which one should be displayed?
What's more imporant than others?


Maps from National Geographic Society is probably an answer for those who are struggling.
Because Natioanl Geographic Society loves their subscribers so much, they are labeling all the cities as possible.
But is their map is the only way?

for paper map, that's probably the best way to do.

What about Web Map?

I make web map.
It should keep balance
