title: What I have learned from Society / 사회로부터 배운 것
---

I have learned from my company and users that Basemap is 잘해야 본전
So what I should concerned is not the map itself but the analyzing abilities.






Apple's map only works with iOS or Mac OSx, and obviously not compatible with Windows, Android, Chrome, and others like not Apple products. </br>

Making a full vector map is very client-side demanding. </br>
When I use other full vector map services, I here my machine makes jet-engine sounds.</br>
I, therefore, think Apple put

 their map service inside their devices



 to make  

 implemented their maps to their own 

based applications so optimization probably 
They do not have service on Web
